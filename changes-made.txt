All the Changes made by me:
--------------------------

1. I have updated the repo folder and file structure as per it should be.

2. Put all the css file in one location and import from index.css file

3. I have updated(ShopApp.tsx file) to function component from Class Component structure as React recommended to use function Component.

4. Instead of setState, I have used hooks such as useState.

5. Every other component file like button.tsx, form.tsx and product-list-component.tsx files need to be changed to function component from class component. 

6. I have used axios for API consume and made a service file for this and refactor the existing codebase for this.


*** their are lots of inline css all over the code. those must be need to changed and moved in a separate file ***
